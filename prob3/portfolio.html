        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Dalton Mann. I am a senior at the University of Memphis. I am majoring in Computer Science and I plan to graduate in
            the fall. I enjoy playing video games, not doing school work, and the Memphis Grizzlies. This portfolio is going to be 
            me describing my favorite players on the team because I don't really know what "projects" to put in this.

                    <h3>Desmond Bane</h3>
                    <p>Desmond Bane is the starting SG for the Grizzlies. He is my favorite player. His three point shooting and ability to
                        drive to the rim makes him an elite offensive threat and opens up his teammates for open looks. He led the team in
                        scoring this year until he missed over a month due to a grade 3 ankle sprain. And yes, that is me in the picture with him.

                    <h3>GG Jackson</h3>
                    <p>GG Jackson is a Forward for the Grizzlies. He is the youngest player in the league, turning 19 this past December. He 
                        was drafted this year to a 2-way contract, not intending to get real minutes on the roster, but a historicly injured
                        Grizzlies team this year has given him an opportunity to earn some real playing time. And he has done so wisely. 
                        Despite being drafted in the second round with pick number 45, he is averaging the 4th most ppg by any rookie this season.
                        That was good enough for him to be signed to a full NBA contract, earning him just under $8 million over the next 4 years.

                    <h3>Vince Williams Jr.</h3>
                    <p>Vince Williams Jr was on the Grizzlies last season, but did not get any real playing time. Much like GG Jackson, Vince
                        was taken with a mid second round pick and was meant to be an end of the bench guy. And also like GG, he was given an 
                        opportunity to become a big part of the rotation because of injuries. He's an elite defender and a great 3 point shooter. 
                        It's incredible that a player this good was rotting away on the bench last season.

                    <h3>John Konchar</h3>
                    <p>John Konchar, nicknamed Jitty, has been a solid role player for the Grizzlies since 2019. He was undrafted and picked up by Memphis
                        in free agency shortly after the draft. Jitty is the type of player that every team needs. He does a little bit of everything
                        and makes winning plays. He hussles for rebounds, has an incredible block highlight real for only being 6'7, gets steals, 
                        and plays good defense. He doesn't need to score to be impactful.

                    <h3>Scotty Pippen Jr.</h3>
                    <p>Yes you read that right. Scotty Pippen Jr is the son of HoF player Scottie Pippen. He's struggled to find a team, but was signed
                        to a 2-way contract in January of this year to fill the need of a point guard while most were out with injuries. He's been very 
                        solid in the time he's gotten this year. He's a good passer, can drive to the lane very well, shoots threes at a decent rate. 
                        He's proving that he could be the backup point guard going into next season and that he deserves a full NBA contract.
