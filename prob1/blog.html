            Could this stuff taste any worse? It's like, "Thanks, but no thanks. I'm still stuffed from that huge bag of smoked almonds!"

            Moon Landing: Real or Fake
        </article_title>
        <p>
            Did we really go to the moon? I don't know man. I wasn't there to see it, so I'm inclined to belive that it never happened.
            No vid, no did, am I right fellas? Seems kinda bogus to me. If we really did go to the moon, wouldn't the astronauts still be there.
            There's no way they could've gotten back. They would've died to fall damage. Can't believe simpletons actually believe everything
            the government tells them. Next thing you know it, people are going to start believing that the Earth revolves around the Sun
            or something stupid like that.
